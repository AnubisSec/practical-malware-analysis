- **Lab01-01.exe**: 2010-12-19 16:16:19 

## 3) Packed/Obfuscated?

- **Lab01-01.dll**: No
- **Lab01-01.exe**:  No

## 4) Import Hints?



### Lab01-01.dll

- CreateMutexA() 
- OpenMutexA()
   *Makes sure that the original process is the only one running*
- socket()
- connect()
- send()
- recv()
- inetaddr()
	*Creates, sends, and receives network connections*



### Lab01-01.exe 

- CreateFileA()
- CopyFileA()
- FindNextFileA()
- FindFirstFileA()
- CreateFileMappingA()
- MapViewOfFile()

	*All indicators that this probably drops a file somewhere on disk, getting it's contents from another*
	

## 5) Host Based Indicators?
	


**Lab01-01.dll strings**:

- exec
- sleep
- hello

	*Possible commands?*
	
- SADFHUHF (*possible mutex name*)

**Lab01-01.exe strings**:

- C:\windows\system32\***kerne132.dll***
- kerne132.dll
- Lab01-01.dll
- WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE



## 6) Network Based Indicators?

### Lab01-01.dll

- 127.26.152.13
- exec
- sleep
- hello


### Lab01-01.exe 

- This only seems to be a dropper, so really no network based indicators

## 7) Suggested Purpose?

My guess is that the exe takes a dll that ships with it, copies it across a bunch of different files within
the file system, and makes them import it as **kerne132.dll**, which then this dll reaches out to a C2 server
and allows for execution of commands through *exec* command.
